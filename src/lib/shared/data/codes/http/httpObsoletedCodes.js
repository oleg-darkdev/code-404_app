    `Unlike the other status codes above, these were not sent as the response status in the HTTP protocol, but as part of the "Warning" HTTP header.`, `Since this "Warning" header is often neither sent by servers nor acknowledged by clients, this header and its codes were obsoleted by the HTTP Working Group in 2022 with RFC 9111.`],
